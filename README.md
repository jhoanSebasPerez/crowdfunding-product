## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

### What I learned

- Get elements from the DOM and add an Event handler, events vary for each type of element.

  ```js
  const input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.addEventListener("input", callback);
  ```

- Creating, showing, and hiding DOM elements dynamically, as well as inserting children and adding styles to them with the help of the browser API

  ```js
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  container.classList.add("class-style");
  container.appendChild(elementChild);

  //to show and hidden element
  container.style.display = "block";
  container.style.display = "none";
  ```

  -Increasing the progress of the bar by combining Javascript and element width with percentage

  ```js
  progressPercentBar.style.width =
    progressPercent >= 100 ? "100%" : `${progressPercent}%`;
  ```

### Continued development

Employ a component-oriented way of programming, making use of libraries such as React JS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Learn the browser API and methods for traversing arrays and JavaScript language syntax, and how to interact with DOM elements
